Incognito open
==============

A chrome extension to open a tab in incognito or "normal" mode.

Re-uses tabs with the same URL.


Usage
-----

`Command+Shift+M` will take the URL of the current tab, and open it in a tab
in a window that is in the inverse-incognito-mode.

If it finds a tab that already has the exactly same URL it will use that tab
instead of creating a new one.
